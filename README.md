# AWS Challenge - Amplify

## Task

Today, you'll get your first hands-on taste of AWS.

First, each person in your pair should [create their own account on AWS](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup#/start). You will need to provide a credit card, but they won't charge you. There is a very generous free tier, and what we're doing today and for the rest of the course will come under it. It's for this reason that this workshop is in individual repos. However, you will be working in pairs, sharing screens, articulating, and working collaboratively like we always do.

Use this repository to follow the instructions in the [guide here](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/build-react-app-amplify-graphql/).

While going through this activity, you'll encounter several new tools and concepts, both in the AWS management console and the code itself. Reminders:

- As usual, don't follow the tutorial by rote and just copy and paste and move on. Instead, take the time to read each line of code carefully. Interrogate it to figure out what it's doing.
- Use the knowledge you already have to apply the concepts you know to new tools. Build your understanding up from those first principles.
- Follow any links to additional information, and if you still don't understand, Google for additional resources (including [videos like this one about GraphQL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIQh02xuVw4)) that break it down in a way that works for you and your partner. If one of you understands first, that's a great opportunity to deepen your understanding by articulating it to your partner!
- Don't move on to the next step of the tutorial until both of you understand what's going on.
- Keep a note of any questions and curiosities that come up as you explore to ask at the end of the day!

## Explore

Once you finish working your way through the task above, keep exploring. Use the resources below, or seek out your own.

Investigate the following AWS services as a starting point together, and make notes together in this readme, articulating to each other as you learn. Your notes should include what do they do, what are they for, how might they be helpful to try out for your projects and beyond, what are the pros and cons, and any questions you might like to ask in the discussion this afternoon.
